# movenet

An attempt to use movenet in flutter

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point to access the movenet api from TensorFlow.

[movenet tutorial in python](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/movenet)

This project also leverages the tflite_flutter package. Please see details on the
page on pub.dev for [tflite_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter).

It is loosely based on the object detection example posted by Amish Garg on Medium
(Real-time object detection using new TensorFlow Lite Flutter Support)[https://medium.com/@am15hg/real-time-object-detection-using-new-tensorflow-lite-flutter-support-ea41263e801d].
